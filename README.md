# Large-Scale Computing Final Project
Kaylah Thomas, Sruti Kanthan, and Angelica Bosko

### Research Topic

Tracking key topics and sentiment towards women during a 12-month
period on the subreddit r/TheRedPill. 

### Research Design 

Reddit spaces can house large communities where like-minded people are able to engage 
in discussion about relevant or interesting topics. On certain occasions, these communities can harbor
prejudiced and violent opinions about groups of people. One particular subreddit, r/TheRedPill, is a place 
where many users, particularly men, share an overwhelmingly negative sentiment about women. In our research,
we intend to analyze trends in discussion about women within the subreddit r/TheRedPill, as well as changes
in sentiment over time. This may offer some insight into how dangerous group think may have a negative 
impact on marginalized communities both online and offline.

### Corpus

In this project, we will be using text data gathered from the comment section 
of posts under the subreddit r/TheRedPill in 2016. In order to gather this text data,
we first use a database containing all reddit data from a particular month in 2016
(https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/) and filter only for the particular
subreddit data we choose to examine. For our data collection, we will be looking at
r/TheRedPill, r/Feminism, and r/technews.
Each monthly raw database contains around 8GB of data.
